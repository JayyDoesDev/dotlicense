# 📝 dotlicense
## Welcome to DotLicense!
### DotLicense is a simple license generator for your github projects. All you need is nodejs and the .license folder pasted into our project and you're good to go!

# 🛠️ Basic Setup
```js
require('./.license/license')('MIT', {
    author: "J_DDev",
    date: new Date().getFullYear()
})
```

# 😅 Side Note
### It's recommended you only copy in the license you will be using for the licenses folder. You don't have to but it's recommended! Either way it will still work!
